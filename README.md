# PyTorch Challenge Scholarship 2018-19

![PyTorch Scholarship](pytorch-acceptance-badge.png)

I created this repository in order to all the resources that I've used for the PyTorch Scholarship Challenge. I found out about the opportunity of applying for a Udacity scholarship through their social media and website.

The Udacity PyTorch Scholarship Challenge took place between **9 November 2018 and 9 January 2019**.

If you're curious you can check the old website [FAQ](https://sites.google.com/udacity.com/pytorch-scholarship-facebook/phase-1-archived/faqs-archived), meanwhile the course itself can be found on Udacity as [Intro to Deep Learning with PyTorch](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-pytorch--ud188).

I wrote a [post](https://masterflorin.github.io/2019/01/11/my-thoughts-pytorch-challenge.html) on my blog about the experience of taking the challenge.

#### I've gathered these resources during and a shortwhile after completing the challenge. While it's not complete it should give you some indication as to I studied during those two months. I'm currently in the process of revising and cleaning up my notes.
