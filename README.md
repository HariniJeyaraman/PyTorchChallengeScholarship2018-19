## About

I created this repository in order to store all the resources that I've used for the PyTorch Scholarship Challenge. I found out about the opportunity of applying for a [Udacity scholarship](https://www.udacity.com/facebook-pytorch-scholarship) through their social media and website.

The Udacity PyTorch Scholarship Challenge took place between **9 November 2018 and 9 January 2019**.

If you're curious you can check the official website and [FAQ](https://sites.google.com/udacity.com/pytorch-scholarship-facebook/phase-1-archived/faqs-archived), meanwhile the course itself can be found on Udacity as [Intro to Deep Learning with PyTorch](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-pytorch--ud188).

I wrote a [post](https://masterflorin.github.io/2019/01/11/my-thoughts-pytorch-challenge.html) on my blog about the experience of taking the challenge.

## Installation

There several notebooks found in this repository so if you would like to run them without issues you can use the same setup as I did by installing the following [dependencies](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch#dependencies).

## Disclaimer

Throughout this repository I have made use of Udacity course material, including screenshots of concepts from their videos. I would like to emphasize that I'm only using them for educational purposes due to their high quality and I'm not going to use them for profit or any commercial activity. Thank you!

### Last note

The repository is not well polished as I've mostly started the work towards the end of the challenge. Moreover, I've continued to work on other projects as well but I still haven't given up hope that one day this will be finally done.
