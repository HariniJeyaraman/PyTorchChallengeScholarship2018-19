## About algorithm implementations

Here are the algorithms and implementations I've worked on during the challenge.

- [Perceptron](Perceptron.ipynb)
- [Implementing and training a simple neural network in Python](Student_Admissions.ipynb)
- [PyTorch]()
	- [Neural Networks](intro-to-pytorch/Part 2 - Neural Networks in PyTorch (Exercises).ipynb)
	- [Training NN](intro-to-pytorch/Part 3 - Training Neural Networks (Exercises).ipynb)
	- [Fashion MNIST](intro-to-pytorch/Part 4 - Fashion-MNIST (Exercises).ipynb)
	- [Inference and validation](intro-to-pytorch/Part 5 - Inference and Validation (Exercises).ipynb)
	- [Transfer Learning](intro-to-pytorch/Part 8 - Transfer Learning (Exercises).ipynb)
