## Course notes

This is the general page for course notes, from where you can select which lessons you want to review.

All of the following course notes and pictures are taken from the Udacity [Intro to Deep Learning with PyTorch](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-pytorch--ud188) course except the version that I took was slightly different as it involved a final lab project.

- [Lesson 2 - Neural Networks](lesson_2.md)
- [Lesson 3 - Talking PyTorch with Soumith Chintala](lesson_3.md)
- [Lesson 4 - Introduction to PyTorch](lesson_4.md)
- [Lesson 5 - Convolutional Neural Networks](lesson_5.md)
- [Lesson 6 - Style Transfer](lesson_6.md)
- [Lesson 7 - Recurrent Neural Networks](lesson_7.md)
- [Lesson 8 - Sentiment Prediction with RNNs](lesson_8.md)
- [Lesson 9 - Deploying PyTorch Models](lesson_9.md)
