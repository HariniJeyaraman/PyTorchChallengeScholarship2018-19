## Course notes

This is the general page for course notes, from where you can select which lessons you want to review.

All of the following course notes and pictures are taken from the Udacity [Intro to Deep Learning with PyTorch](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-pytorch--ud188) course except that the version that I took of the course was slightly different as it involved a final lab project.
