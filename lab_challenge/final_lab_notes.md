# Final lab challenge notes

As of now, I uploaded one version of what I used for the project. It's a bit messy as at the time I was working on it Google Colab did not have full support for PyTorch 0.4.1 at the moment so in order to clean it up, I removed the EDA and inference parts. Fortunately, this has changed and Colab provides support not only for PyTorch but also fast.ai. 

In the near future I will update the notebook.
